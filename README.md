You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting is a valuable skill to cement your learning. It also will help add context to refresh your memory when you use your portfolio in the future. Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?
The Client was DrivePass, they required a system for students to learn how to drive by connecting them with their staff instructors for driving appointments. I think with my design one aspect we did very well was the appointment system, it creates a safe, quick and effecient way to setup the driving lesson appointments and how for instructors to leave feedback and notes. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the UML Class diagram, I initially had some struggle understanding where to start with it, while I did eventually get going with something and created a whole project plan out of it, it still started off a little rusty.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The interview allowed me the space to take notes and convert those requests into requirements and into functions of the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like approaching it with the user focus perspective, imagining if I was the user how would I prefer for the system to work. I also think drawing out physical app designs of the user flows is helpful to dig through what I want the process to look like. Also starting with a minimum viable product and building off of it.
